    Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers.
     he also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140.

     Suryakumar's first international came belatedly in 2021, whereupon he hooked the first ball he faced in a T20I, from Jofra Archer, for six. 
     He produced two fifties in his first three T20Is, and the year after, made 117 off 55 in a game where India fell short in the face of a massive 215 by England.
